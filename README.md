## List any assumptions you have before starting with the project

- created folder for each component so that it is easy to navigate.
- I assumed that you did not need me to use any state management tools like Redux, as that is not my strength yet but I am in the process of learning it. So I fetched my data in the same files I used them.
- I prioritized the required fields and did not put so much attention to the optional ones

## How to run the application

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Reason for specific designs and interfaces

I used the same designs that as the one in Figma mock-up, that pages may not look the exactly same everywhere but the are very similar. I used it because I liked it and reduced the design job for me.

## List any encountered obstacles and how you solved them

- Testing, it was my first time ever testing. It took me a while before I could get my testings to pass. I did only one unit test, which was testing the HeadLink() function.
- Pasing props through Link router, it took me a while before I could get right.
- Other syntax errors.
- Adding image to the store page was a problem, the url link was not found. Since it was not a required field, I shifted my focus to required fields. 

## List resources used and relevant references

- StackOverFlow for most of the errors I was getting
- For react router https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start 
- For testing, I watched a couple of videos but this one was mostly useful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgnxcUQ5vho 

## How long you took to complete the assignment

3 days total

## If you had more time, what would you do differently? Also, what would you have added additionally?

- Gave myself time to use Redux for my code to be shortened and more readable.
- In Store page,I would have added functionality to the "view more" button, how many deals info and image.
